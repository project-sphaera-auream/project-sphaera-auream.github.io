>> 100x is not fast enough!

$$ Then tell us what is!

>> We need to operate at least 10 orders of magnitude faster than biological life
>> In a single day we could replicate the same technological advancements since the early studies of electricity!

$$ We do not have the budget to allow this

>> Now listen, we built the whole neural pool for scalability. But what if we limit it to at most a couple uses?
>> We no longer need to support the bandwidth for densly distributed biological computation!

$$ Okay. We can reduce the scope.
$$ But such a last minute architecture decision.... how do we know it's safe?

>> I will go in first

$$ That's insane! You're leading the whole project!
$$ Who will take your place in ProjSA?

>> There is no time for caution. We are at the edge of a scientific experiment nobody has evver attempted before.

$$ Do we provision a new account for you?

>> No. I'll go in with sudo,

$$ As you wish
